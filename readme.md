# ofxGphoto

ofxGphoto wraps [libgphoto](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2) to [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/). It is strongly oriented towards [ofxEdsdk](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxEdsdk), both in forms of usage and internal workflow.

libgphoto is a C library that enables the communication with a [lot of digital cameras](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php).

## Installation/Usage on Linux

Arch linux
```
sudo pacman -S libgphoto2
